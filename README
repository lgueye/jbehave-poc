Little application I work on to explore technologies I'm interested in.

So far those feature are implemented and backup by Jbehave tests :
 - Jersey REST framework (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, Content negociation, error handling, Security)
 - JBehave BDD tool (maven integration)
 - Elasticsearch search engine (index, mapping, full text search, exact match search)
